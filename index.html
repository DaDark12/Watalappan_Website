      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Watalappan traces its roots to the Malay community in Sri Lanka, introduced during the 18th century. Over time, it evolved into a staple dessert at weddings, festivals, and Eid celebrations, symbolizing sweetness and unity. Its name likely originates from the Malay word *“Wattilappam”*, meaning “cup pudding.”</p>
      <p>Traditionally, it’s made with *kithul jaggery* (palm sugar), eggs, coconut milk, and fragrant spices like nutmeg and cardamom — a fusion of tropical simplicity and royal richness.</p>
