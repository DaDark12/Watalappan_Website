    <h2>📜 History</h2>
    <p>Watalappan dates back to the 18th century, introduced by the Sri Lankan Malays. The word “Watalappan” likely comes from the Malay “Wattalappam,” meaning “cup cake pudding.” It combines tropical coconut milk with the Middle Eastern custard tradition. Over time, it became a national treasure, appearing in weddings, festivals, and Eid celebrations.</p>
